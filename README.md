This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project 

## Quick info.
This is an Instagram Clone made in NextJS. 
I used here ```NextAuth``` to get google provider and information. ```Recoil``` for global state management ```Firebase``` for backend and database and ```Tailwind``` for styling. 

### You can Add posts. 
It uses SSR to fetch the posts and display them on Frontend. 

This is great project where I learned how how to connect google apis with nextauth and firebase.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
