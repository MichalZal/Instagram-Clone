This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project 

## Quick info.
This is an Instagram Clone made in NextJS. 
I used here ```NextAuth``` to get google provider and information. ```Recoil``` for global state management ```Firebase``` for backend and database and ```Tailwind``` for styling. 

### You can Add posts. 
It uses SSR to fetch the posts and display them on Frontend. 

This is great project where I learned how how to connect google apis with nextauth and firebase.


# Getting Started

### First clone the repository 

### Then use ```npm i``` to install dependencies.

### Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

### Create Firebase project and copy the project settings to ```Firebase.jsx``` 

### Then use this project in Google cloud and add OAuth2.0 to make info providing available. Add localhost:3000 to the good urls.

### Copy secret and id, and paste them to the .local.env. Then the proccess of getting information from google Apis will be available.
